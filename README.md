# Hello-Cards
eCommerce Project

This is a mock website I built from scratch in Visual Studio Code for my e-commerce/eCommerce class (CIS235) at Rio Salado College in December 2025. It advertises products for a (fake) card shop, complete with an example newsletter subscription system.
Please feel free to click around and explore! This site is also mobile-compatible.

I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually-intriguing website complete with example product images, pricing, interactive buttons, and cart/checkout areas. 
My goals in this project were to create a unique, attractive, easy-to-digest website while furthering my e-commerce knowledge in advertising potential products, maintaining focus on Hello! Cards's specific brand identity.
I focused on implementing simplicity and cleanliness, using attractive product pictures, and providing important/contingent product and pricing details for the customer to make the buying process easy.

Highslide is a JavaScript library used to zoom in on images so customers can have a more detailed view of a product as they wish.
Snipcart uses both HTML and Javascript to create a built-in e-commerce platform where one can create purchase buttons and payment fields, manage orders, handle taxes and shipping, and create/activate discount codes for customers.
I also made use of the platform's features to code live price updates in one's cart when purchasing multiple items. Some products feature different dropdown/radio/checkbox options when viewing the cart, as well.

For Hello! Cards, I researched typical market prices for the listed card-related products, keeping in mind the store's foundation in affordability and style, as well as how similar establishments advertised their products.
This project provides just a small highlight of my knowledge of user-friendly navigation, dynamic checkout processes, building customer trust, varied product assortments, cybersecurity, and focus on the target market/ICP.
